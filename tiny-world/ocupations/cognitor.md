Cognitor
========

A @Cognitor is an Adeptus Mechanicus magos specialized in information storage and retrieval.
@Cognitors are savants, data addicts, born within the Mechaniucs.

A high-level @Cognitor is permanently affixed to a throne, connected by thick data wires to a very powerful data engine.
That throne is also connected to a @ThinkPod, which interfaces between the @Cognitor and the hundreds of human minds they use to retrieve data from the @GrandArchive.
