The Mind Hive
=============

An archive city. So vast is its knowledge, that most of its population must be dedicated to collaborating in information retrieval.
Most people work in the @Cognitarium, an information factory.
There, special magos called @Cognitors use pods of hundreds of human minds (@ThinkPods) to sift through data, looking for answers to the Imperium's questions.
These human pods are hired from the hab blocks of the mid-hive, where most of the population lives.
